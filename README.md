# ReconXploration: Unraveling Magnetic Reconnection
Official Submission of Team "ReconXploration:" for NASA Space Apps Challenge 2023 participating in the challenge “Magnetic Reconnection”
# Introduction:
Magnetic reconnection is a process that can occur almost anywhere that a magnetic field is found. In a reconnection event, the magnetic field lines are squeezed together somehow and spontaneously reconfigure themselves. This releases energy. When it occurs near the surface of the Sun, such an event powers giant solar flares that can release thousands of millions of tonnes of electrically charged particles into space.
